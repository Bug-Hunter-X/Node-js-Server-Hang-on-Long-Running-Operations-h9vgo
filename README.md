# Node.js Server Hang on Long-Running Operations

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers: hanging on long-running operations without proper response handling.  The original `server.js` file includes a long-running operation that doesn't send a response to the client, causing the server to hang. The `server-fixed.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses this problem.  This issue is often overlooked and can lead to poor application performance and unresponsive servers.

## Problem

The initial implementation simulates a long operation that takes a certain amount of time. During this time, the server does not respond to the client, leading to a hang.

## Solution

The solution includes enhancements to handle long-running operations efficiently, ensuring that the server remains responsive and sends a response back to the client, even if the operation takes time to complete. Techniques such as event listeners, callbacks, and asynchronous patterns can solve this.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `node server.js` to see the original buggy code and the hang issue.
4. Run `node server-fixed.js` to see the solution and its correct behavior.
